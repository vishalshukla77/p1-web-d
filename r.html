        At the outset, Indian Institute of Information Technology Ranchi (IIIT Ranchi) is a fully the
        autonomous technical institute set up by an act of Parliament 2016 as an ‘Institute of National
         Importance’. It is operational in Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Mode with financial and commitment
          administrative support of Government of India (50%), Government of Jharkhand (35%) and industry
           partners - Central Coalfield Limited (CCL) (5%), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) (5%) and Tata Technologies Ltd (5%). 
           IIIT Ranchi is the only institute dedicated to Information Technology in the state of Jharkhand working in 
           close collaboration with the industry and dedicated to giving IT support to mining and mineral industries 
           as well as higher technical education and skill development in IT. IIIT Ranchi draws on a reserve of 
           extraordinary talent by selective, stringent and amazingly successful Joint Entrance Exam (JEE MAIN) for admission to its UG Programs with an intake of 60 students each in B. Tech (Honours) Computer Science Engineering & B. Tech (Honours) Electronics and Communication Engineering. However, in the first batch admitted in an academic session, the sanctioned student strength was only 60 with 30 in two individual
            branches. At present, we have a strength of 120 students in a batch with 60 students per branch per
             batch. NIT Jamshedpur stands as the mentor Institute of IIIT Ranchi and the Institute is currently 
             running from a temporary independent campus at Namkum, Ranchi, allotted by the Government of Jharkhand.
              The Institute's main campus of 52 acres has been allotted at Kanke, Ranchi and will be functioning by
               the year 2021. As a part of perseverant strives to bring the top companies to the institute premises,
                you are cordially invited to conduct a mutually serviceable placement drive for the CSE & ECE B. Tech.<BR>
